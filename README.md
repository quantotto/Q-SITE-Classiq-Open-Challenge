# QSite 2024 - Classiq Open Challenge Submission

This work is submitted by Yevgeny Menaker (team Quantotto).

Here is the brief description of the submitted files:

- [classiq_qsite_2024_open_challenge_quantotto.pdf](classiq_qsite_2024_open_challenge_quantotto.pdf) - presentation of the solution
- [harmonic_oscillator_diffeq.ipynb](harmonic_oscillator_diffeq.ipynb) - Jupyter notebook implementing and analyzing the quantum algorithm
- [diff_eq.qmod](diff_eq.qmod) - quantum model
- [diff_eq.qprog](diff_eq.qprog) - quantum program

I attest that all the work was done solely by myself. The use of "we" in the presentation is merely a writing style. If external sources were used, they are attributed in References or Credits in the code.

Thanks for the challenge, team Classiq!<br>
Thanks for oragnizing the event, team Q-Site!
