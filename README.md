# QSite 2024 - Classiq Open Challenge Submission

This work is submitted by Yevgeny Menaker (team Quantotto).

Here is the brief description of the submitted files:

- classiq_qsite_2024_open_challenge_quantotto.pdf - presentation of the solution
- harmonic_oscillator_diffeq,ipynb - Jupyter notebook implementing the quantum algorithm and variety of calculations based on it
- diff_eq.qmod - quantum model
- diff_eq.qprog - quantum program

I attest that all the work was done solely by myself. The use of "we" in the presentation is merely a styling choice. If external sources were used, they are attributed in References or Credits in the code.

Thanks for the challenge, team Classiq!
